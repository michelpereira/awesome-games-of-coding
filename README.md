## TIS-100

TIS-100 is an open-ended programming game by Zachtronics, the creators of SpaceChem and Infinifactory, in which you rewrite corrupted code segments to repair the TIS-100 and unlock its secrets. It’s the assembly language programming game you never asked for!

## Shenzhen I/O

Shenzhen I/O is a game in which you build circuits using a variety of components from different manufacturers, like microcontrollers, memory, and logic gates, and then write code in a compact and powerful assembly language where every instruction can be conditionally executed.

## Screeps

Screeps is about scripting your creeps. No point’n’clicking any longer! You write real JavaScript* which controls your units autonomously. Any time, everywhere, even while you are offline.

(* Or any other language using compilers.)
